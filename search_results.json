(Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) has published positive results from the cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) portion of the two-part Phase 2 LILAC study (Part B) evaluating litifilimab (known as BIIB059), an investigational drug for the treatment of lupus.

We are excited to progress this promising candidate into late-stage development to further evaluate its potential, particularly in those who historically have been underserved.”\n\nThe Phase 2 LILAC Part B Results\nLILAC was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of litifilimab versus placebo in two parts: Part A in participants who had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active joint and skin manifestations; and Part B in participants with moderate-to-severe active CLE, including active subacute and chronic subtypes, with or without systemic manifestations. As previously reported,2,3 both Part A and Part B of the study met their respective primary endpoints, with litifilimab demonstrating superior efficacy to placebo in reducing total active joint count and improving skin disease activity in participants with SLE and CLE, respectively.\n\nPart B of the LILAC study assessed multiple doses of litifilimab or placebo in participants with active, histologically confirmed CLE. The primary analysis included a test of dose-response to assess whether there was a response across the four dose groups (placebo, 50, 150, or 450 mg litifilimab, administered subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12) on the basis of the primary endpoint of skin disease activity. This Phase 2 trial was not powered to assess secondary endpoints.\n\nThe LILAC study population in Part B was representative of the broader CLE patient population, with approximately 10 percent of participants who reported race and ethnicity identifying as Black or African American. In Part B, litifilimab demonstrated a significant dose-response relationship based on the percent change from baseline in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI-A) score (primary endpoint), a measure of skin disease activity, at Week 16.\n\nIn Part B, litifilimab was generally well tolerated, with most reported adverse events (AEs) rated as mild or moderate. The most common AEs reported in ≥5% of participants in the pooled litifilimab groups were nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site erythema, SLE, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, pruritus, and cough.\n\nDetailed findings for Part A of LILAC, which enrolled participants with SLE with active joint and skin manifestations, will be published separately in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAbout Litifilimab (BIIB059)\nLitifilimab (known as BIIB059), discovered and developed in-house by Biogen scientists, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). BDCA2 is a receptor that is exclusively expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), and it has been shown to reduce inflammatory production from pDCs, including type-I IFN (IFN-I) as well as other cytokines and chemokines. These inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic and cutaneous lupus.\n\nAbout Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)\nCLE, a type of lupus, is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that can occur with or without systemic manifestations; people with CLE frequently experience symptoms including rash, pain, pruritis (itch) and photosensitivity as well as skin damage that may worsen over time and can include irreversible scarring alopecia and dyspigmentation that can be disfiguring and substantially impact quality of life.4-7\n\nAlthough anyone can develop lupus, an estimated 90 percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-40.6 The disease disproportionately impacts diverse ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic/Latino communities.9-12 There is currently no cure for lupus.\n\nDecades of study by Biogen on pathways at the intersection of neurology and immunology provide the company with expertise in specialized immunology. Biogen is advancing two lupus therapies in Phase 3 trials. Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed in collaboration with UCB for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The second, litifilimab (BIIB059), was fully developed in-house at Biogen and is now in Phase 3 for SLE, with plans for further study in CLE.\n\nAbout Biogen\nAs pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen discovers, develops, and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies.

CLE is associated with a decrease in quality of life and increased depression. In some forms of the disease, patients may experience scarring, skin atrophy and alopecia.\n\nSLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission. SLE can present itself in several ways including rash, arthritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, serositis, nephritis, seizures or psychosis. SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.\n\nAbout Biogen\nAt Biogen, our mission is clear: we are pioneers in neuroscience.

The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized. ArmA group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment , or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol . Arm typeA general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm , active comparator arm , placebo comparator arm , sham comparator arm , and no intervention arm . Baseline characteristicsData collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment).\n ... \nSection Title: Glossary\nContent:\nThis type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA . **Treatment IND/Protocol** : Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA . This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use. Experimental armAn arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial. Extension requestIn certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date ). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial).\nSection Title: Glossary\nContent:\nAll requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See [Delay Results Type](/policy/results-definitions) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information.

        "# New England Journal of Medicine Publishes Positive Data of Litifilimab in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus\n\nAugust 21, 2022 —\n\nWe are pleased to share positive results from the two-part Phase 2 LILAC study published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ showing that the investigational therapy litifilimab (BIIB059) lessened skin disease activity in cutaneous lupus erythematosus. There is a great unmet need for people with cutaneous lupus, a type of lupus with few treatment options that causes inflammation to the skin.\n\nData showed that the study met its primary endpoint, meaning that litifilimab was more effective than placebo in reducing skin disease activity. Results at 16 weeks of treatment also showed that increasing doses of litifilimab improved the benefit as evaluated by a widely accepted measure of skin disease activity.\n\nDiscovered by scientists at the biotechnology company Biogen, litifilimab targets BDCA2, a protein found on cells of type I interferons (IFNs).

(Nasdaq: BIIB) announced that the first patient has been dosed in the global clinical study, AMETHYST. The Phase 2/3 study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and assess the safety of litifilimab (also known as BIIB059), a first in-class, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2), as compared to placebo, in participants with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). AMETHYST is expected to be conducted at approximately 238 sites worldwide and aims to enroll 474 adults with CLE.\n\n“CLE is more severe and frequent among African American and Hispanic/Latino patients, compared to white patients, which is why for AMETHYST we have set enrollment targets with the objective of appropriate representation for these traditionally underrepresented groups,” said Priya Singhal, M.D., M.P.H., Head of Global Safety and Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of R&D at Biogen. “We are excited to advance litifilimab into what will be one of the largest clinical studies in CLE, where there are currently insufficient treatment options that address the needs of people living with this disease.”\n\nAMETHYST is a two-part, Phase 2/3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of litifilimab compared to placebo. The Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts of the study will each be 52 weeks in duration. Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous treatment with litifilimab or placebo every four weeks for 20 weeks with an additional loading dose at Week 2. All participants will receive litifilimab during the 28-week extended treatment period from Weeks 24 to 48. The primary endpoint will assess the effect of litifilimab on skin disease activity, compared to placebo.\n\nMore information on the AMETHYST study (NCT05531565) is available at clinicaltrials.gov and BiogenTrialLink.\n\nAbout Litifilimab (BIIB059)\nLitifilimab (known as BIIB059), discovered and developed in-house by Biogen scientists, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting BDCA2 and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). BDCA2 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs). Binding of litifilimab to BDCA2 has been shown to reduce production of pro-inflammatory molecules by pDCs, including type-I interferon (IFN-I) as well as other cytokines and chemokines.3,4 These pro-inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic and cutaneous lupus.\n\nAbout Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)\nCLE, a type of lupus, is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that can occur with or without systemic manifestations; people with CLE frequently experience symptoms including rash, pain, pruritis (itch) and photosensitivity as well as skin damage that may worsen over time and can include irreversible scarring, alopecia and dyspigmentation that can be disfiguring and substantially impact quality of life.5-8\n\nAlthough anyone can develop lupus, an estimated 90 percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-40.7 The disease disproportionately impacts diverse ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic/Latino communities.10-13 There is currently no cure for lupus.\n\nDecades of study by Biogen on pathways at the intersection of neurology and immunology provide the company with expertise in specialized immunology. Biogen is advancing two lupus therapies in Phase 3 trials. Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed in collaboration with UCB for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Litifilimab (BIIB059), was fully developed in-house at Biogen and is now in Phase 3 for SLE and in Phase 2/3 for CLE.\n\nAbout Biogen\n\nAs pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen discovers, develops, and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies. One of the world’s first global biotechnology companies, Biogen was founded in 1978 by Charles Weissmann, Heinz Schaller, Sir Kenneth Murray, and Nobel Prize winners Walter Gilbert and Phillip Sharp.

(Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the global clinical study, TOPAZ-1. The Phase 3 study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and assess the safety of BIIB059, a first in-class, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2), as compared to placebo, in participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). TOPAZ-1 is expected to be conducted at approximately 135 sites worldwide and aims to enroll 540 adults with active SLE.\n\n“A chronic autoimmune condition such as lupus, which overwhelmingly affects women, has a tremendous impact on my patients’ daily lives, including their physical, mental and social wellbeing,” said Richard Furie, M.D., Chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Northwell Health and Professor at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. “There remains a significant need for efficacious and generally safe treatment options for lupus patients. Based on the positive results observed in the Phase 2 LILAC study, we are excited to continue to evaluate the potential of BIIB059 in TOPAZ-1.”\n\nTOPAZ-1 is a 52-week, multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 compared with placebo. Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous treatment with BIIB059 at one of two doses or placebo every four weeks with an additional dose at Week 2, in addition to their existing lupus therapy.\n\n“We look forward to working with the lupus community as we advance the clinical development of BIIB059 with the hope of bringing a meaningful new treatment option to people living with systemic and cutaneous lupus,” said Nathalie Franchimont, M.D., Ph.D., Head of the Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology Development Unit at Biogen. “Additionally, we are reinforcing Biogen’s commitment to the inclusion of underrepresented groups in our clinical trials. We have set enrollment targets that reflect the prevalence of SLE in African-American and Hispanic/Latinx communities with the aim to achieve appropriate representation in the TOPAZ-1 study.”\n\nThe primary objective of TOPAZ-1 is to demonstrate reduction in disease activity as measured with the primary endpoint, proportion of participants who achieve an SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response at Week 52. SRI is a composite index using validated indices to measure global and organ-/system-specific disease activity. Key secondary endpoints will evaluate the effect of BIIB059 on additional efficacy parameters including proportion of patients achieving SRI-4 response at Week 24, oral corticosteroid use, organ-specific disease activity (joint and/or skin) and flare rates. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study duration.\n\nThe initiation of the TOPAZ-1 study is based on the results from the Phase 2 LILAC study. In LILAC, BIIB059 met its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reduction of disease activity in patients with SLE. The majority of adverse events in the LILAC study were mild or moderate.\n\nMore information on the TOPAZ-1 study (NCT04895241) is available at clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nAbout BIIB059\nBIIB059, discovered and developed exclusively by Biogen, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). BDCA2 is a receptor that is exclusively expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), and it has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokine production from pDCs, including type-I IFN (IFN-I). Inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of lupus.\n\nAbout Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nSLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission. SLE can present itself in several ways including rash, arthritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, serositis, nephritis, seizures or psychosis. SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease. There are an estimated four million people worldwide impacted by SLE.i\n\nAlthough anyone can develop lupus, an estimated ninety percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-40.ii The disease disproportionately impacts certain ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic/Latinx communities.iii,iv,v,vi There is currently no cure for lupus.\n\nBiogen is advancing two investigational lupus assets in Phase 3 studies: BIIB059, an anti-BDCA2, and dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40L being developed in collaboration with UCB, which began a Phase 3 trial in 2020.\n\nAbout Biogen\nAt Biogen, our mission is clear: we are pioneers in neuroscience. Biogen discovers, develops and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies. One of the world’s first global biotechnology companies, Biogen was founded in 1978 by Charles Weissmann, Heinz Schaller, Kenneth Murray and Nobel Prize winners Walter Gilbert and Phillip Sharp.

(Nasdaq: BIIB) will host a virtual investor seminar today at 10:00 a.m. ET focused on its lupus portfolio led by two potential first-in-class late-stage assets, litifilimab and dapirolizumab pegol (DZP, developed in collaboration with UCB). Lupus is a highly heterogeneous disease, comprising multiple subtypes with symptoms that vary widely by patient. To date, it is estimated that millions of people worldwide have a form of lupus.1 Building on its deep expertise in pioneering treatments for complex immune conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS), Biogen aims to develop an industry-first lupus portfolio. This includes advancing two Phase 3 assets: litifilimab that has shown strong Phase 2 proof of concept results in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), and dapirolizumab pegol that has completed one positive Phase 3 study in SLE with a second Phase 3 study ongoing.\n\nThe webcast will illustrate the science behind the portfolio and strategic opportunities to improve and expand treatment options for people with lupus. Specifically, it will feature the distinct mechanisms of action and compelling data supporting litifilimab and DZP, along with details of the Phase 3 designs and expected timing of data readouts. The company will also highlight its proven capabilities in navigating multifaceted diseases and product launches.\n\n“Lupus is a complex set of diseases with a highly heterogeneous, undertreated patient population that needs more options,” said Priya Singhal, M.D., M.P.H., Head of Development at Biogen. “We are advancing multiple therapies with distinct mechanisms of action across lupus indications to address the challenges faced by the lupus community. Strong clinical data from our late-stage programs of litifilimab and dapirolizumab pegol support the potential for a lupus franchise to be a pillar of Biogen’s mid to long-term growth.”\n\nJoin Today’s Seminar \nTo join today's event, please go to the investors section of the Biogen website at investors.biogen.com or access the event link directly. An archived version of the webcast and slides, as well as additional video presentations and slides, will also be available. \n\nSignificant Unmet Medical Needs in Lupus\n\nLupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs when the body’s own immune system attacks healthy tissues, including in the skin, joints, kidneys, brain and other organs, causing a wide range of debilitating symptoms and, if not appropriately treated, potentially irreversible damage to the skin and internal organs. There is currently no cure for the estimated 5 million people worldwide1 who have a form of lupus. Lupus disproportionately affects women of color, particularly Black, Asian, Hispanic and Native American women, who face higher rates of incidence, more severe symptoms, and barriers to care.\n\nDespite the prevalence of lupus, the heterogeneity and involvement of multiple organ systems have been a significant scientific barrier to discovering new, effective treatments. From 1955 through 2011, only one new treatment was approved. Today, there are only two approved treatments for SLE and none for CLE. Additional treatment options are needed as it is estimated that only 20% of people diagnosed with SLE are currently receiving targeted therapies beyond the standard of care.2\n\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\nSLE, the most common form of lupus, is a chronic disease where the immune system attacks the body’s own healthy tissues. It can affect multiple organs in the body and often comes in cycles -- with periods of flare-ups followed by times of little or no disease activity. SLE can present itself in different ways, including skin rashes, arthritis, anemia, inflammation around the heart, lungs or abdomen, kidney problems, seizures and changes in mental health.\n\nCutaneous Lupus Erythematosus\n\nCLE can occur with or without systemic manifestations with frequent symptoms including rash, pain, itch and sensitivity to sunlight as well as skin damage that may worsen over time and can include irreversible scarring, hair loss and abnormal skin color that can be disfiguring and substantially impact quality of life. Presently, there are no treatments approved for CLE.\n\nLitifilimab Clinical Development Program\n\nLitifilimab, discovered and developed in-house by Biogen scientists, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting BDCA2 and is being investigated in patients with SLE and CLE. BDCA2 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs). Binding of litifilimab to BDCA2 has been shown to reduce production of pro-inflammatory molecules by pDCs, including type-I interferon (IFN-I) as well as other cytokines and chemokines. These pro-inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic and cutaneous lupus.\n\nPositive results from the SLE portion of the two-part Phase 2 LILAC study were previously published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) showing litifilimab met the study’s primary endpoint by significantly reducing total number of swollen and tender joints in participants with SLE from baseline compared to placebo over 24 weeks. In LILAC, litifilimab was generally well tolerated. Two Phase 3 trials with litifilimab in SLE, TOPAZ-1 (NCT04895241) and TOPAZ-2 (NCT04961567), are currently ongoing.\n\nThe Phase 2 LILAC study with litifilimab was among the first randomized controlled trials in CLE. In 2022, The New England Journal of Medicine published positive results from the CLE portion of the LILAC study, which met the primary endpoint with litifilimab demonstrating superior efficacy to placebo in reducing skin disease activity. In LILAC, litifilimab was generally well tolerated. These positive results supported the initiation of the ongoing pivotal AMETHYST study (NCT05531565) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of litifilimab compared to placebo in CLE.\n\nDapirolizumab Pegol Clinical Development Program\n\nDapirolizumab pegol is a novel investigational humanized Fc-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab’) fragment. Dapirolizumab pegol inhibits CD40L signaling which has been shown to reduce B cell activation and autoantibody production, mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion, and attenuate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation. Dapirolizumab pegol is presently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of SLE under a collaboration between UCB and Biogen.\n\nIn November 2024, Biogen presented, in collaboration with UCB, positive Phase 3 results for DZP, a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate and one of only three agents ever to have demonstrated a positive global Phase 3 trial in SLE.\n\nThe PHOENYCS GO study (n=321) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically and clinically significant improvement of moderate-to-severe SLE disease activity as measured by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA). After 48 weeks, study participants receiving DZP plus standard of care (SOC) had a statistically significant 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 25.8; p=0.0110) higher response rate (49.5%) than those receiving SOC alone (34.6%). In additional analyses of the study, DZP showed efficacy across multiple clinical endpoints, including fatigue and measures of disease activity/remission. Given the key secondary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, subsequent secondary and tertiary endpoints are descriptive. In the study, the safety profile of DZP was generally favorable.\n\nA second Phase 3 trial of DZP, PHOENYCS FLY (NCT06617325) is in progress and is intended to support a regulatory filing.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab pegol in SLE have not been established, and it is not approved for use in SLE by any regulatory authority worldwide.\n\nIn early-stage development, felzartamab is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 study in lupus nephritis.\n\nAbout Felzartamab\n\nFelzartamab is an investigational therapeutic human monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, a protein expressed on mature plasma cells. Felzartamab is a potential first-in-class therapeutic candidate with promise as a pipeline-in-a-product across a range of immune-mediated diseases. Felzartamab has been shown in clinical studies to selectively deplete CD38+ plasma cells, which may allow applications that ultimately improve clinical outcomes in a broad range of diseases driven by pathogenic antibodies. Felzartamab was originally developed by MorphoSys AG (now MorphoSys GmbH, a Novartis company). Human Immunology Biosciences (HI-Bio) exclusively licensed the rights to develop and commercialize felzartamab across all indications in all countries and territories excluding China (including Macau and Hong Kong and Taiwan). Biogen acquired HI-Bio in July 2024.\n\nFelzartamab is an investigational therapeutic candidate that has not yet been approved by any regulatory authority and its safety and effectiveness have not been established.\n\nAbout Biogen\nFounded in 1978, Biogen is a leading biotechnology company that pioneers innovative science to deliver new medicines to transform patient’s lives and to create value for shareholders and our communities. We apply deep understanding of human biology and leverage different modalities to advance first-in-class treatments or therapies that deliver superior outcomes. Our approach is to take bold risks, balanced with return on investment to deliver long-term growth.\n\nWe routinely post information that may be important to investors on our website at www.biogen.com. Follow us on social media - Facebook, LinkedIn, X, YouTube.\n\nBiogen Safe Harbor\nThis news release and the related investor conference call contain forward-looking statements, including relating to: Biogen’s aim to develop an industry-first lupus portfolio; the potential benefits, safety and efficacy of litifilimab and dapirolizumab pegol (DZP, developed in collaboration with UCB); the growth potential of lupus treatments given current therapies; the potential for lupus treatments to be a pillar of Biogen’s long-term growth; the anticipated benefits, risks and potential of Biogen's collaboration arrangements with UCB; the innovation of our lupus and other pipeline products; Biogen’s plan to build on its leading development and commercialization capabilities in autoimmune disease to expand into the lupus market; the potential of Biogen’s pipeline in early-stage development, including felzartamab in lupus nephritis; potential regulatory discussions, submissions and approvals and the timing thereof; the risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization; and our future financial and operating results and financial guidance. These forward-looking statements may be accompanied by such words as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “prospect,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning. Drug development and commercialization involve a high degree of risk, and only a small number of research and development programs result in commercialization of a product. Results in early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of full results or results from later stage or larger scale clinical trials and do not ensure regulatory approval. You should not place undue reliance on these statements. Given their forward-looking nature, these statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that may be based on inaccurate assumptions and could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Given their nature, we cannot assure that any outcome expressed in these forward-looking statements will be realized in whole or in part.\n\n We caution that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control and could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document, including, among others, factors relating to: uncertainty of our long-term success in developing, licensing, or acquiring other product candidates or additional indications for existing products; expectations, plans, prospects and timing of actions relating to product approvals, approvals of additional indications for our existing products, sales, pricing, growth, reimbursement and launch of our marketed and pipeline products; the potential impact of increased product competition in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry, as well as any other markets in which we compete, including increased competition from new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways; our ability to effectively implement our corporate strategy; difficulties in obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement for our products; the drivers for growing our business, including our dependence on collaborators and other third parties for the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of products and other aspects of our business, which are outside of our full control; risks related to commercialization of biosimilars, which is subject to such risks related to our reliance on third-parties, intellectual property, competitive and market challenges and regulatory compliance; the risk that positive results in a clinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials or success in early stage clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later stage or large scale clinical trials or trials in other potential indications; risks associated with clinical trials, including our ability to adequately manage clinical activities, unexpected concerns that may arise from additional data or analysis obtained during clinical trials, regulatory authorities may require additional information or further studies, or may fail to approve or may delay approval of our drug candidates; and the occurrence of adverse safety events, restrictions on use with our products, or product liability claims; and any other risks and uncertainties that are described in other reports we have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nThese statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and the discussions during this conference call and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and in our subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, in each case including in the sections thereof captioned “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in our subsequent reports on Form 8-K. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\nReferences:\n\n 1.

Results from the SLE portion of the study (Part A) published today show litifilimab met the study’s primary endpoint by significantly reducing total active joint count compared to placebo. Positive data from the CLE portion of the study were published in NEJM on July 28th, 2022.\n\n“Lupus is a debilitating autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation, pain and organ damage, and predominantly affects women and people of color,” said Richard Furie, M.D., The Marilyn and Barry Rubenstein Chair in Rheumatology, Chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Northwell Health and Professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. “Litifilimab has been shown to inhibit the production of type I interferons as well as other inflammatory mediators produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Strong evidence has accumulated that these mediators contribute to disease activity in lupus.”\n\nBiogen is currently enrolling participants into the Phase 3 TOPAZ-1 and TOPAZ-2 studies, which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of litifilimab in participants with active SLE at 269 clinical trial sites worldwide. As part of Biogen’s commitment to delivering diversity in its clinical trials, enrollment targets have been set in the TOPAZ studies to achieve appropriate representation of the African American and Hispanic/Latino communities. Biogen also plans to initiate a pivotal study of litifilimab in CLE in 2022.\n\n“This second NEJM manuscript shows the totality of data from the Phase 2 LILAC program, reinforcing our belief in the potential of litifilimab as a first-in-class therapy for both systemic and cutaneous lupus,” said Nathalie Franchimont, M.D., Ph.D., Head of the Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology Development Unit at Biogen. “At Biogen, our goal is to discover and develop new treatment options that not only reduce lupus disease activity but also decrease clinical manifestations that impact patients the most. We look forward to continuing our evaluation of litifilimab in Phase 3 studies and sharing additional data when available.”\n\nThe Phase 2 LILAC Part A Results\nLILAC was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of litifilimab versus placebo in two parts: Part A in participants who had SLE with active joint and skin manifestations; and Part B in participants with moderate-to-severe active CLE, including active subacute and chronic subtypes, with or without systemic manifestations. As previously reported, both Part A and Part B of the study met their respective primary endpoints, with litifilimab demonstrating superior efficacy to placebo in reducing total active joint count and improving skin disease activity in participants with SLE and CLE, respectively.\n\nIn Part A of LILAC, litifilimab significantly reduced the total number of swollen and tender joints in participants with SLE from baseline compared to placebo over 24 weeks. This Phase 2 trial was not powered to assess secondary endpoints.\n\nIn Part A, litifilimab was generally well tolerated, with most reported adverse events (AEs) rated as mild or moderate. The most common AEs reported in ≥5% of participants in the pooled litifilimab groups were diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, fall and headache.\n\nAbout Litifilimab (BIIB059)\nLitifilimab (known as BIIB059), discovered and developed in-house by Biogen scientists, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). BDCA2 is a receptor that is exclusively expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs). Binding of litifilimab to BDCA2 has been shown to reduce production of pro-inflammatory molecules by pDCs, including type-I interferon (IFN-I) as well as other cytokines and chemokines.1,2 These pro-inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic and cutaneous lupus.\n\nAbout Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nSLE, the systemic form of lupus, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of inactivity.3 SLE can present itself in several ways including rash, arthritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, serositis, nephritis, seizures or psychosis.4 SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.\n\nLupus affects an estimated 5 million people worldwide.5 An estimated 90 percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-40.6 The disease disproportionately impacts diverse ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic/Latino communities.6-10 There is currently no cure for lupus.\n\nDecades of study by Biogen on pathways at the intersection of neurology and immunology provide the company with expertise in specialized immunology. Biogen is advancing two lupus therapies in Phase 3 trials. Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed in collaboration with UCB for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The second, litifilimab (BIIB059), was fully developed in-house at Biogen and is now in Phase 3 for SLE, with plans for further study in CLE.\n\nAbout Biogen\nAs pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen discovers, develops, and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies.

      "markdown": "US Rheumatologists Believe Biogen’s Litifilimab Is the Leading SLE Pipeline Asset Poised to Offer Improvement Over Benlysta and Saphnelo Based on Clinical Trial Data\n\nDespite favorable views on litifilimab, AbbVie’s Rinvoq\nand BMS’ Sotyktu capture the most prescriber interest for approval, according\nto Spherix Global Insights.\n\n\nEXTON, PA., September 12, 2024 — The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) advanced treatment landscape is poised for evolution, with multiple new therapies in development to treat this debilitating and chronic disease. While Biogen’s litifilimab has shown promise in its Phase II clinical trial, other contenders such as AbbVie’s Rinvoq (upadacitinib) and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) could further broaden the options in rheumatologists’ treatment armamentarium.\n\nThe recent quarter three update from Spherix Global Insights’ RealTime Dynamix™: SLE study presented rheumatologists with the current efficacy profiles of emerging therapies. According to US rheumatologists (n=101), litifilimab stands out as an especially strong competitor to established biologics such as GSK’s Benlysta and AstraZeneca’s Saphnelo. Many rheumatologists believe that litifilimab’s Phase II efficacy data, particularly its 26% improvement in SRI-4 response over placebo, demonstrates a superior treatment profile compared to existing biologics and other promising therapies, including Rinvoq, Sotyktu, Biogen and UCB Pharma’s dapirolizumab pegol, and Idorsia’s cenerimod.\n\nRinvoq and Sotyktu also produced positive Phase II efficacy data in their clinical trials. These oral therapies offer convenience for patients and may appeal to rheumatologists seeking alternative treatment options. While oral medications are often preferred by SLE patients, adherence can be a challenge, potentially impacting long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the black box warning associated with JAKs may prevent use in earlier lines of SLE treatment.  Indeed, nearly half of surveyed rheumatologists agree that the black box warning for JAK inhibitors could significantly impact their use of this drug class in SLE.\n\nDespite these potential challenges, rheumatologists are most eager to see Rinvoq approved for SLE, followed by Sotyktu and litifilimab, all of which are believed to be potentially effective for skin manifestations. In contrast, Novartis’ ianalumab and Roche/Genentech’s Gazyva (obinutuzumab) garner average interest in prescribing but are viewed as potentially effective for renal involvement.\n\nNew entrants to the market will need to compete with the established dominance of Benlysta, which remains a preferred choice in both SLE and lupus nephritis (LN). Its availability in both subcutaneous and intravenous forms, along with the high level of comfort and familiarity rheumatologists have developed over time, has made it a popular option for rheumatologists and patients. Moreover, its well-documented safety record may be its most compelling advantage, further solidifying its position in the lupus market.\n\nAstraZeneca and Aurinia have each carved out success by targeting their therapies to specific patient populations. AstraZeneca’s Saphnelo has become the preferred choice for rheumatologists treating chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) due to its effectiveness in managing skin-related symptoms. Similarly, Aurinia’s Lupkynis has demonstrated strong efficacy in patients with high, persistent proteinuria, making it the top option for both rheumatologists and nephrologists in this group. For new market entrants, identifying the patient populations where they can make the greatest impact will be crucial to challenging Benlysta’s established dominance.\n\nAs litifilimab, Rinvoq, Sotyktu and other investigational assets approach potential regulatory approvals, they are expected to provide much-needed diversity in treatment options for SLE patients. Nevertheless, they will need to demonstrate not only strong efficacy but also safety, ease of administration, and long-term benefits to compete with established therapies like Benlysta and other emerging therapies.\n\nRealTime Dynamix™ is an independent service providing strategic guidance through quarterly or semiannual reports, which include market trending and a fresh infusion of event-driven and variable content with each wave.

      "markdown": "Biogen R&D Day to Provide Overview of Diversified Pipeline and Capabilities with Potential for Multiple Novel Therapies in Neuroscience\n\n* 33 early and late-stage clinical programs across modalities and innovative discovery platforms\n   \n * Uniquely positioned to lead in Alzheimer’s disease with ADUHELM® (aducanumab-avwa) and industry-leading pipeline including Phase 3 lecanemab\n * Potential to transform standard of care in several areas of high unmet need in depression, ALS, stroke and lupus\n * Biomarkers and digital health to enable early diagnosis and personalized medicine\n * Continued leadership in neuroscience sustained by distinct capabilities and talent\n   \n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 21, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) will hold a virtual Investor R&D Day today, providing a comprehensive overview of the company’s diversified pipeline in neuroscience. Biogen plans to advance innovative therapies for patients through the work of its world-class researchers and the strength of its global network of collaborators. As part of R&D Day, Biogen’s scientific leaders will discuss ongoing research and highlight key advancements among Biogen’s 33 clinical programs, including 12 programs in Phase 3 or filed.\n\n“Biogen is helping to change the Alzheimer’s disease treatment paradigm by providing the first therapy in 20 years, and we continue to lead the way in neuroscience with our diversified pipeline,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “Across our portfolio, we have achieved significant scientific progress, and I believe our specialization in terms of people, capabilities, and programs positions us to deliver multiple novel therapies with the potential to address the most complex neurological diseases.”\n\nKey R&D Highlights\n“The talented team at Biogen is at the forefront of innovation in neuroscience. We look forward to sharing the assets and approaches we have developed aimed at addressing some of the most difficult challenges in healthcare,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Biogen. “Scientific advancements have increased our understanding of human genetics and allow us to advance the appropriate treatment modality for the right target for each disease. We believe this will mitigate risk in neuroscience, increase the probability of success for each program, and create opportunities for early and targeted treatments towards prevention.”\n\nAlzheimer's Disease\nBiogen will present an overview of its Alzheimer’s disease pipeline with the recent FDA-approved ADUHELM serving as the foundation of a multi-target, multi-modality Alzheimer’s disease franchise. In addition to ADUHELM, the company will present progress on lecanemab (BAN2401), a new amyloid beta-directed antibody therapy in Phase 3 being developed by Eisai in collaboration with Biogen, and BIIB080 (IONIS-MAPTRx), a tau-directed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO).\n\nLecanemab received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in June 2021. In clinical studies, lecanemab has shown potential to slow clinical decline in Alzheimer’s disease and is now being studied in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease as well as the preclinical setting, when individuals are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains.\n\nA Phase 1b study of BIIB080 met the primary objective of safety and tolerability, and demonstrated a durable time and dose dependent reduction of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid. Growing evidence suggests tau may be a key driver of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nNeuropsychiatry\nIn neuropsychiatry, Biogen and Sage Therapeutics are co-developing zuranolone, and will present an overview of the two-week, once-daily drug being studied in major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD). Zuranolone has demonstrated positive Phase 3 results.\n\nIn clinical trials, zuranolone, which represents a potential new class of drug, demonstrated rapid-acting efficacy and was generally well-tolerated. Beyond MDD and PPD, zuranolone may have potential for development in other psychiatric disorders, including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is a common comorbidity of multiple neurological disorders in Biogen’s core therapeutic areas.\n\nBiogen will also present an overview of BIIB104, currently under investigation in a Phase 2 study for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\nBiogen has multiple ALS assets in development, which target both genetic subtypes of ALS and the broader population. Tofersen, developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is currently in Phase 3 studies. The program targets SOD1, a gene believed to be a genetic driver of disease in two percent of all ALS cases.\n\nIn the recently announced ATLAS study, Biogen will be exploring the use of tofersen prior to symptoms in SOD1 carriers with the intent to delay or slow the decline in function associated with ALS.\n\nBased on learnings from the company’s prior and ongoing trials, Biogen is also advancing BIIB078, an ASO targeting C9orf72, another potential genetic driver of ALS, and BIIB105, an ASO targeting ATXN2, a potential treatment for ALS in the broader population supported by human genetics.\n\nStroke\nBiogen is progressing its research in the treatment of stroke. The potential to expand the stroke treatment window has been shown in positive proof of concept studies for BIIB131, a next generation thrombolytic agent, and BIIB093, a treatment for brain swelling in large hemispheric infarctions.\n\nBIIB131, a treatment for acute ischemic stroke, was recently acquired based on positive Phase 2 data. BIIB093 is in a Phase 3 study for large hemispheric infarction, and a Phase 2 trial for lesion expansion in brain contusion.\n\nLupus\nDecades of study by Biogen at the intersection of neurological and immunological pathways provide the company with expertise in immunology. Biogen is advancing two lupus therapies in Phase 3 trials. Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed in collaboration with UCB for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The second, BIIB059, was fully developed in-house at Biogen and is now in Phase 3 for SLE, with plans for further study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.\n\nDistinct Capabilities and World-Class Talent\nBiogen has attracted and collaborated with leading scientists from industry and academia to focus on treatments with the highest unmet need. This focus also includes 27 business development transactions and collaborations since 2017, including with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Denali Therapeutics Inc., Sage Therapeutics Inc, and InnoCare Pharma Limited. Biogen will continue to bolster the pipeline through both internal development and external collaborations.\n\nBiogen has refined the early discovery process with new approaches to patient selection, target engagement, and monitoring of disease progression, increasing the probability of success for each program. Biogen centers its R&D methodologies on human biology, employing the predictive effects of genetics to validate potential targets. Utilizing biomarkers to measure modulation of disease early on in the drug development process can contribute to lowering the risk associated with developing novel therapies for neurological diseases.\n\nBiogen Digital Health\nToday’s technological advances open a new era of opportunities for digital health in neuroscience. In April 2021, the company formed Biogen Digital Health, a global unit that aspires to transform patients’ lives and Biogen by making personalized and digital medicine in neuroscience a reality. In an on-demand presentation, Biogen Digital Health will share key areas of focus and highlights, including progress on digital biomarkers and efforts to develop deep-learning software.\n\nInvestor R&D Day Presenters\nBiogen scientific leaders will be joined by executives from Eisai, Sage Therapeutics, and Denali Therapeutics.\n\nTo join today's event, please go to the investors section of the Biogen website at investors.biogen.com or access the event link directly here.\n\nAn archived version of the webcast and slides, as well as additional video presentations and slides, will be available here.\n\nAbout ADUHELM® (aducanumab-avwa) injection 100 mg/mL solution\nADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\nAducanumab-avwa is a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid beta. The accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain is a defining pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer’s disease. The accelerated approval of ADUHELM has been granted based on data from clinical trials showing the effect of ADUHELM on reducing amyloid beta plaques, a surrogate biomarker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, in this case a reduction in clinical decline.\n\nADUHELM can cause serious side effects including: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities or “ARIA”. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms but can be serious. Although most people do not have symptoms, some people may have symptoms such as: headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes and nausea. The patient’s healthcare provider will do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and during treatment with ADUHELM to check for ARIA. ADUHELM can also cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects of ADUHELM include: swelling in areas of the brain, with or without small spots of bleeding in the brain or on the surface of the brain (ARIA); headache; and fall. Patients should call their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.\n\nAs of October 2017, Biogen and Eisai Co., Ltd. are collaborating on the global co-development and co-promotion of aducanumab.\n\nPlease click here for full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide, for ADUHELM.\n\nAbout Biogen\nAt Biogen, our mission is clear: we are pioneers in neuroscience.

(Nasdaq: BIIB) announced that the first patient has been dosed in the global clinical study,\nAMETHYST. The Phase 2/3 study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and assess the safety of litifilimab (also known as BIIB059), a first in-class,\nhumanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2), as compared to placebo, in participants with cutaneous\nlupus erythematosus (CLE). AMETHYST is expected to be conducted at approximately 238 sites worldwide and aims to enroll 474 adults with CLE.\n\n\"CLE is more severe and frequent among African American and Hispanic/Latino patients, compared to white patients, which is why for AMETHYST we\nhave set enrollment targets with the objective of appropriate representation for these traditionally underrepresented groups,\" said Priya Singhal, M.D.,\nM.P.H., Head of Global Safety and Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of R&D at Biogen. \"We are excited to advance litifilimab into what will be\none of the largest clinical studies in CLE, where there are currently insufficient treatment options that address the needs of people living with this\ndisease.\"\n\nAMETHYST is a two-part, Phase 2/3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of litifilimab\ncompared to placebo. The Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts of the study will each be 52 weeks in duration. Participants will be randomized to receive\nsubcutaneous treatment with litifilimab or placebo every four weeks for 20 weeks with an additional loading dose at Week 2. All participants will receive\nlitifilimab during the 28-week extended treatment period from Weeks 24 to 48. The primary endpoint will assess the effect of litifilimab on skin disease\nactivity, compared to placebo.\n\nMore information on the AMETHYST study (NCT05531565) is available at clinicaltrials.gov and BiogenTrialLink.\n\nAbout Litifilimab (BIIB059)\nLitifilimab (known as BIIB059), discovered and developed in-house by Biogen scientists, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting\nBDCA2 and is being investigated for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).\nBDCA2 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed on a subset of human immune cells called Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs). Binding of\nlitifilimab to BDCA2 has been shown to reduce production of pro-inflammatory molecules by pDCs, including type-I interferon (IFN-I) as well as other\ncytokines and chemokines.3,4 These pro-inflammatory mediators are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic and cutaneous\nlupus.\n\nAbout Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)\nCLE, a type of lupus, is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that can occur with or without systemic manifestations; people with CLE frequently\nexperience symptoms including rash, pain, pruritis (itch) and photosensitivity as well as skin damage that may worsen over time and can include\nirreversible scarring, alopecia and dyspigmentation that can be disfiguring and substantially impact quality of life.5-8\n\nAlthough anyone can develop lupus, an estimated 90 percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of\n15-40.7 The disease disproportionately impacts diverse ethno-racial groups, including African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native and\nHispanic/Latino communities.10-13 There is currently no cure for lupus.\n\nDecades of study by Biogen on pathways at the intersection of neurology and immunology provide the company with expertise in specialized\nimmunology. Biogen is advancing two lupus therapies in Phase 3 trials. Dapirolizumab pegol is being developed in collaboration with UCB for systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE). Litifilimab (BIIB059), was fully developed in-house at Biogen and is now in Phase 3 for SLE and in Phase 2/3 for CLE.\n\nAbout Biogen\n\nAs pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen discovers, develops, and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological\ndiseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies. One of the world's first global biotechnology companies, Biogen was founded in 1978 by Charles\nWeissmann, Heinz Schaller, Sir Kenneth Murray, and Nobel Prize winners Walter Gilbert and Phillip Sharp. Today, Biogen has a leading portfolio of\nmedicines to treat multiple sclerosis, has introduced the first approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, and developed the first and only\napproved treatment to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Biogen is also commercializing biosimilars and focusing on advancing one\nof the industry's most diversified pipelines in neuroscience that will transform the standard of care for patients in several areas of high unmet need.\n\nIn 2020, Biogen launched a bold 20-year, $250 million initiative to address the deeply interrelated issues of climate, health, and equity. Healthy\nClimate, Healthy LivesTM aims to eliminate fossil fuels across the company's operations, build collaborations with renowned institutions to advance the\nscience to improve human health outcomes, and support underserved communities.\n\nWe routinely post information that may be important to investors on our website at www.biogen.com.

SLE affects multiple organ systems, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission.\n\nCLE is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy skin, often causing painful or itchy rashes and skin lesions.\n\nThe Phase II LILAC two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study analysed the safety and efficacy of BIIB059 versus placebo in 264 patients.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence\n\n\nUS Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?\n\nDon’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.\n\nBy GlobalData\n\nIt enrolled individuals with active CLE, including chronic and subacute subtypes, with or without systemic manifestations (part B) and those with SLE with active joint and skin manifestations (part A).\n\nThe SLE part enrolled 132 patients and evaluated a 450mg dose of a BIIB059 injected subcutaneously once every four weeks versus placebo.\n\nAn additional dose at week two was given to individuals with active SLE.\n\nThe Phase II LILAC study (part A) met its primary endpoint of reducing joint disease activity in individuals with SLE.\n\nSubjects who received BIIB059 450mg showed a statistically significant difference in change from baseline of 3.4 in total active joint count at week 24 versus placebo.\n\nThe secondary endpoint of SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) was met, resulting in an overall reduction in disease activity in participants who received BIIB059.\n\nThe efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of the drug support the continued clinical development of BIIB059 in SLE."
