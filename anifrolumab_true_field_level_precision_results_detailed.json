The title \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\" is overly generic and does not capture the specific details such as the indication for SAPHNELO, its limitations of use, or the context of its administration.\n   **Fix**: The `output_json` should include more detailed and structured information extracted from the `input_text`. For example:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"IndicationTabs\": {\n           \"title\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\",\n           \"indications\": \"SAPHNELO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who are receiving background immunosuppressive therapy.\",\n           \"limitations_of_use\": \"SAPHNELO is not recommended for use in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus.\"\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. `\"input_text\": \"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE: SAPHNELO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who are receiving background immunosuppressive therapy.

Key sections such as \"Dosage and Administration\" and \"Adverse Reactions\" are omitted entirely.\n   **Fix**: The `output_json` should include structured data for all relevant sections of the `input_text`. For example:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"IndicationTabs\": {\n           \"title\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\",\n           \"indications\": \"SAPHNELO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who are receiving background immunosuppressive therapy.\",\n           \"limitations_of_use\": \"SAPHNELO is not recommended for use in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus.\",\n           \"dosage_and_administration\": \"300 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period every 4 weeks.\",\n           \"adverse_reactions\": \"The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 20%) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and infusion-related reactions.\",\n           \"pediatric_use\": \"The safety and efficacy of SAPHNELO in pediatric patients have not been established.\"\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- The `output_json` should aim to capture all relevant sections of the `input_text` in a structured and hierarchical format.\n- The current `output_json` is overly simplistic and fails to represent the richness of the `input_text`.",

The input text specifies that SAPHNELO is indicated for \"moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who are receiving background immunosuppressive therapy.\" However, the `output_json` only mentions \"Moderate to severe disease state,\" which is vague and does not specify the condition (SLE) or the requirement for background immunosuppressive therapy.\n   **Fix**: Update the `output_json` to include the full context from the input text.
